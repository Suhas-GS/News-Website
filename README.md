The developer version of News API only allows us to send requests in the local host and can't be accessed in a deployed site. So in order to see the live demo of this website, download all the files in a folder and using a code editor run it on a live server. And also it's recommended to create your own free API key from https://newsapi.org/ and paste it in the 1st line of script.js file to avoid any errors.
